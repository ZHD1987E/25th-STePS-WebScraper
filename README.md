# What even is this?

I was a student helpter for the [25th STePS](https://uvents.nus.edu.sg/event/25th-steps), taksed to run the event alongside other students and even the professors.

As preparations for the event did entail a lot of manual entry, I decided to create this webscraper (though very basic) to help me scrape links and project titles for what I need. It picks up the project title and YouTube links from individual project pages (e.g. ".../CS6010/1") and converts them to a handy Markdown page.

# Why is it now on GitHub?

Yeah, I decided that it would be best to:
- Let my other team members access the Markdown files as a neat summary **instead of having to go to each individual site!**

# I want this taken down!
