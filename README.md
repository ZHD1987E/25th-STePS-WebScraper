# What is this?

The 25th STePS had this autoscraper to automate document generation workflows.

This time round... I decided to extend this to the 26th STePS because there may be even more groups to deal with! In fact, this edition has 69 teams compared to 43 teams in the previous iteration.

Since NUS Computing will celebrate some anniversary this time round, they might choose to ramp up the number of teams exhibiting with more courses on show. That means a lot of work for staff members!

Therefore, to ease that workflow, I decided to create a central webscraper where people can retrive the needful.
