# What is this?

The 25th STePS had this autoscraper to automate document generation workflows.

This time round... I decided to extend this to the 26th STePS because there may be even more groups to deal with! In fact, this edition has 69 teams compared to 43 teams in the previous iteration.

Since NUS Computing will celebrate some anniversary this time round, they might choose to ramp up the number of teams exhibiting with more courses on show. That means a lot of work for staff members!

Therefore, to ease that workflow, I decided to create a central webscraper where people can retrive the needful.

# What happened next?

Then, someone told me that it's possible to now get the API instead of scraping web data, which means that data syncing can now be done much faster.

From then, it was pretty much a migration over to direct API use.

Hopefully, with integration to UVENTS' awards system, it is now possible to fully automate the generation of certificates, thereby reducing the manpower needed.

# What should I know?

I wish I could download videos. Too bad, YouTube would not allow me to do so. Hopefully, with enough research I can automate the download of videos and park them in the Github repo.
